    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Combining flavors of cranberry and orange to create a tender and beautiful loaf that everyone will love!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup warm water</li>
        <li>1 package rapid-rise yeast</li>
        <li>3/4 cup warm milk</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1/4 cup orange marmalade</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>3 cups bread flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup old-fashioned oats</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Filling</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups chopped fresh cranberries</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons chopped walnuts</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 egg white</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Glaze</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon frozen orange juice concentrate</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon water, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine warm water and yeast in a large bowl; stir to dissolve. Add warm milk, egg, marmalade, and butter. Stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Mix flour, oats, and salt together in a separate bowl. Add to yeast mixture and stir until moistened. Knead dough until smooth and elastic, 6 to 8 minutes. Place dough in a greased bowl, turning to coat both sides. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes.            
        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine cranberries, brown sugar, and water in a small saucepan. Cook over medium heat until cranberries begin to soften, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in walnuts, butter, and lemon juice. Let cool.           
        </li>
        <li>Punch dough down. Roll dough into a 10x20-inch rectangle on a floured surface.</li>
        <li>Whisk egg white and water together. Brush lightly over the dough. Spread cranberry filling over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border on all sides. Roll up tightly, starting from a long edge. Seal edges and cut off any tapered sides with no filling.
        </li>
        <li>Transfer roll to a large square baking sheet. Join ends together to form a ring. Use sharp kitchen shears to make cuts at 1-inch intervals, cutting 2/3 of the way through the dough. Twist each slice gently to expose the swirled filling. Gently shape dough into a perfect ring. Cover and let rise until doubled, 20 to 25 minutes.           
        </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 25 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 20 minutes before removing to a wire rack. Let cool completely.           
        </li>
        <li>Stir powdered sugar and orange juice concentrate together in a small bowl. Add enough water to reach a glaze-like consistency. Drizzle glaze over tea ring. Allow glaze to set before slicing.           
        </li>
    </ol>

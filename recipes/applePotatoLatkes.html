    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A nontraditional approach to a potato latke. You will love it!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 russet potato, peeled</li>
        <li>1 firm apple, peeled</li>
        <li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon maple syrup</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make a deep vertical cut on each side of the potato and apple.</li>
        <li>Attach potato to a spiralizer fitted with the small shredded blade and cut into thin shreds. Repeat with apple. Spread shredded potato and apple on several layers of paper towels; squeeze to release as much moisture as possible. Transfer to a bowl.
        </li>
        <li>Mix egg, flour, maple syrup, salt, and nutmeg into the bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Spoon 2 tablespoons of the potato mixture into the skillet; flatten slightly with a spatula. Cook until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Drain on a plate lined with paper towels. Repeat with remaining mixture, adding more oil if needed.</li>
    </ol>
